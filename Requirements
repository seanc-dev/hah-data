II. Update existing data -- N.B. ONLY DO WHEN READY TO COMPLETE CHANGEOVER
    1. In spreadsheets
        a. Get mapping of suburbs to territories
        b. Add 'area' column in spreadsheets and cut existing data into it

Functionality:
1. Area field working
2. Existing data updated
**3. New API working
