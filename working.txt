Bits and pieces
1. Change error handling for DB calls in routes/services/queries to be logging, not throwing.
2. set up a process to do this regularly into google sheets for each of the tables too. 
    Cheap and easy dr.
3. Remove createddatetime from client post call
4. Remove records duplicated across single orgs in client
5. Add unique constraint to staff table (name)

Remaining: 
1. Update client delete route
2. Test job delete route
3. Process to push data to sheets (this doesn't have to be awaited).
    a. Use the getData.crud and DataObject.init("new") situation
4. Tidy up bits and pieces.

WIP:
1. createJob still failing on staff_job_hours insert, with no error message :/
    a. Best approach might be to extract the values from debugger and attempt a manual insert in sql..
