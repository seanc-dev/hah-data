Bits and pieces
1. Change error handling for DB calls in routes/services/queries to be logging, not throwing.
2. Set up a process to regularly drop tables into google sheets.
    => Cheap and easy dr.

WIP:
- client sheet update is failing because it's so fucking ugly. 
- current error is that getRowObject is not pulling through (client object not retrieved 
    from sheet). No idea why this is happening, but I've set some breakpoints in the dataobject
    file so as to identify it. Just need to run in debugger mode.
- p.s. also removed the logging in queries/job.js without re-testing it lol.
