Need to turn this into a single page app so there isn't the trouble with refreshing the clients list before it has updated in 
the sheet.

This will mean the following:
1.  Change form submission to ajax.
    What's involved in changing form submission to ajax? 
    a.  Change form routing from a post method post to an axios put call to that same endpoint.
    b.  Add e.preventDefault() to successful submission flow.
    c.  Update clientDetails array on submission (completed).
    d.  Perform form validation against DB at submission (re-initiate loading overlay while this is in progress).
    e.  Clear form upon successful submission.
    f.  Modularise 'error-message' span so that it can also indicate success. This should also clear when a user switches between
        forms.
