Need to turn this into a single page app so there isn't the trouble with refreshing the clients list before it has updated in 
the sheet.

This will require changing form submission to ajax. What's involved?
    a.  Change form routing from a post method post to an axios post call to that same endpoint.
        -   $('form').serializeArray()[0] to get form data
        -   Add e.preventDefault() to successful submission flow.
        -   Perform form validation against DB at submission. Fail submission if validation fails, else pass submission.
        -   Fire axios POST to /[form type] in submit function.
    c.  Update clientDetails array on submission (completed).
    e.  Clear form upon successful submission.
        -   formElement.reset() to reset form element
    f.  Modularise 'error-message' span so that it can also indicate success. This should also clear when a user switches between
        forms.
