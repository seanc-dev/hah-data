//  Work left to complete change to New/View/Edit/Delete

//  1.  Fix stickiness of status-message
// X2.  Implement handler for client/job record selection
// X3.  Vary axios call for submit on edit
//  4.  Correct append of data to client/job details after submit
//  5.  Test :)

//  Rationalise and clean up index.js

//  1.  Remove if/else statement from index.js
//  2.  Rename initialiseAppData as initialiseFormOptions.
//  3.  Set buildForms function to run off then statement from initialiseAppData

    //  Need to consider whether this is the best architecture. Might be better to pool all axios calls in one place
    //  so app can be loaded completely before loading screen clears.

//  Clean up routes

//  1.  Remove 'keys' call from client and data and add to /data? route
//  2.  Re-point front end call for keys (in generation of View/Delete view)
