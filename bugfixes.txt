1.  Fix 'Error: undefined' issue.
    -   Custom error message presenting as undefined when form resubmit attempted after validation had already failed. 
    -   Removed complexity re removing and re-adding submit event handler and this did it.
2.  Fix issue with client details list updating on refresh before previously submitted client submitted to DB.
    -   Added setTimeout delay to 'local storage already exists' option so that the ajax reload takes extra 2 seconds.
        -   This is an absolutely hideous fix, but it is temporary.
    -   This will require rebuild into SPA to fix properly (please see working.txt).
